# Matrix Solver in MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB script to solve a system of linear equations using matrix operations. The script utilizes the backslash operator (`\`) to find the solution.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (any version that supports basic matrix operations)
- Visual Studio Code (optional, for code editing)

## Installation

1. **MATLAB**: Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your computer.
2. **Visual Studio Code**: If you prefer to edit your code in VS Code, install it from [the official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. **MATLAB Extension for VS Code**: Install the MATLAB extension from the VS Code Marketplace for syntax highlighting and code snippets.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

2.How to run the code;
run('example.m')

3. The Equation it is solving in MATRIX form;
2x + 1y = 5  
1x + 3y = 8
